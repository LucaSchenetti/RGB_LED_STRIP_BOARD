🌈 RGB LED Strip Controller Board (24VDC, STM32)
This board is designed to control a 24VDC RGB LED strip using an STM32 microcontroller. It offers precise PWM control of the red, green, and blue channels via high-power MOSFETs, allowing smooth dimming and color mixing. Perfect for smart lighting, decoration, or industrial applications.

⚡ Features
🔌 24VDC input — compatible with standard 24V RGB LED strips

🎛 STM32 microcontroller — generates high-frequency PWM for flicker-free dimming

🟢🔴🔵 3 independent MOSFET drivers — dedicated channels for Red, Green, and Blue

💪 Robust power stage — designed for high current loads

🛡 Protection circuits — reverse polarity and overcurrent protection

🔧 Easy wiring — terminal blocks for LED strip and power connections

📐 Compact form factor — ready for integration into custom enclosures

💡 Typical Applications
🏠 Ambient and architectural lighting

🎨 Decorative RGB installations

🛠 DIY smart lighting projects

🏭 Industrial machine status indicators
